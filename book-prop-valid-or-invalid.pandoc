# Valid or invalid

Here we focus on distinguishing valid from invalid arguments via a discussion of a series of examples.

<br>

*Example 1*

Use the table to assess the validity of the argument:

```{.TruthTable .Validity system="gamutPND" options="nodash autoAtoms" submission="none"}
 p/\q :|-: q
```

Hence, is the argument with premise $p\wedge q$ and conclusion $q$ a valid argument?

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Yes or no?
| *Yes.
| No.
```

<br>

*Example 2*

Use the table to assess the validity of the argument:

```{.TruthTable .Validity system="gamutPND" options="nodash autoAtoms" submission="none"}
 ~e\/f :|-: ~e
```

Hence, is the argument with conclusion $\neg e$ and premise $\neg e\vee f$ a valid argument?

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Yes or no?
| Yes.
| *No.
```

<br>

*Example 3*

Use the table to assess the validity of the argument:

```{.TruthTable .Validity system="gamutPND" options="nodash autoAtoms" submission="none"}
 ~j,~z :|-: ~(j\/z)
```

Hence, is the argument with conclusion $\neg (j\vee z)$ and premises $\neg j$ and $\neg z$ a valid argument?

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Yes or no?
| *Yes.
| No.
```

One way to quickly assess validity is to see this argument as a valid argument obtained from an equivalence. Which equivalence can this be seen as an instance of? *Hint: the comma separating the premises acts like a conjunction.*

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Which is it?
| law of double negation
| associativity
| *DeMorgan
| distributivity
```

<br>

*Example 4*

Use the table to assess the validity of the argument:

```{.TruthTable .Validity system="gamutPND" options="nodash autoAtoms" submission="none"}
 q :|-: p\/q
```

Hence, is the argument with conclusion $p\vee  q$ and premise $p$ a valid argument?

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Yes or no?
| *Yes.
| No.
```

<br>

*Example 5*

Consider how large the table would be to assess the validity of the following:

<p style="margin-left: 40px"> $r,t\vdash s\vee (r\wedge t)$ </p>

It turns out that this is a valid argument. What substitution should you do to see this, on the basis of Example 4? Recall Example 4 was the valid argument $q \vdash p\vee q$.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Which one?
| *substitute s for p and substitute r/\ t for q.
| substitute t for p and substitute r/\ s for q.
| substitute r/\ t for p and substitute s for q.
| substitute r/\ s for p and substitute t for q.
```

<br>

*Example 6*

Use the table to assess the validity of the argument, keeping in mind that the initial three columns are ordered alphabetically (i.e. $r,s,t$):

```{.TruthTable .Validity system="gamutPND" options="nodash autoAtoms" submission="none"}
 t\/s :|-: (t\/s)/\r
```

Hence, is the argument with conclusion $(t\vee s)\wedge r$ and premise $t\vee s$ a valid argument?

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Yes or no?
| Yes.
| *No.
```

*Hint: think about $t\vee s$ as it appears in the premise and as part of the conclusion as a single proposition (like $p$).*

<br>

*Example 7*

Use the table to assess the validity of the argument:

```{.TruthTable .Validity system="gamutPND" options="nodash autoAtoms" submission="none"}
 ~a, ~a->b :|-: b
```

Hence, is the argument with conclusion $b$ and premises $\neg a$ and $\neg a\rightarrow b$ a valid argument?

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Yes or no?
| *Yes.
| No.
```

Which of the following is this example a substitution-instance of:

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Which is it?
| *modus ponens
| modus tollens
| affirming the consequent
| denying the antecedent
```

<br>

*Example 8*

Use the table to assess the validity of the argument:

```{.TruthTable .Validity system="gamutPND" options="nodash autoAtoms" submission="none"}
 c, ~d->c :|-: ~d
```

Hence, is the argument with conclusion $\neg d$ and premises $c$ and $\neg d\rightarrow c$ a valid argument?

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Yes or no?
| Yes.
| *No.
```

Which of the following is this example a substitution-instance of:

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Which is it?
| modus ponens.
| modus tollens.
| *affirming the consequent.
| denying the antecedent.
```

<br>

*Example 9*

Use the table to assess the validity of the argument:

```{.TruthTable .Validity system="gamutPND" options="nodash autoAtoms" submission="none"}
 u\/v, u->v :|-: u
```

Hence, is the argument with premises $u\vee v$ and $u\rightarrow v$ and conclusion $u$ a valid argument?

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Yes or no?
| Yes.
| *No.
```

<br>

*Example 10*

Consider how large the table would be to assess the validity of the following:

<p style="margin-left: 40px"> $c\wedge (d\wedge e)\vdash e$ </p>

 It  turns out this argument is valid. One way to see it is to answer the following question:

What is the one circumstance in which $c\wedge (d\wedge e)$  is true?

 ```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
  Which is it?
 | when exactly one of the propositional letters is true.
 | when exactly two of the propositional letters are true.
 | *when all three of the propositional letters are true.
 ```

Another way to discern the validity of the argument is to "chain together" the following two valid arguments:

<p style="margin-left: 40px"> $c\wedge (d\wedge e)\vdash d\wedge e$  and $d\wedge e\vdash e$ </p>

The second validity $d\wedge e\vdash e$ is clearly a substitution-instance of Example 1 (which recall said that $p\wedge q \vdash q$).

But what substitution do you have to do to see that the first validity $c\wedge (d\wedge e)\vdash d\wedge e$ is a substitution-instance of Example 1? Recall again Example 1 said that  that $p\wedge q \vdash q$.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Which is it?
| substitute d for q, and substitute c/\ e for p.
| *substitute c for p, and substitute d/\ e for q.
| substitute d for p, and substitute c/\ e for q.
| substitute c for q, and substitute d/\ e for p.
```

<br>

*Example 11*

Use the table to assess the validity of the argument (this validity undergirds the "chaining" we mentioned in the previous example).

```{.TruthTable .Validity system="gamutPND" options="nodash autoAtoms" submission="none"}
 p->q, q->r :|-: p->r
```

Hence, is the argument with premises $p\rightarrow q$ and $q\rightarrow r$ and conclusion $p\rightarrow r$ a valid argument?

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Yes or no?
| *Yes.
| No.
```

<br>


*Example 12*

Here is another way to think about the validity from the previous example:

<p style="margin-left: 40px"> $p\rightarrow q, q\rightarrow r \vdash p\rightarrow r$ </p>

What is the one circumstance in which the conclusion $p\rightarrow r$ is false?

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Which is it?
| when p is true and r is true.
| *when p is true and r is false.
| when p is false and r is true.
| when p is false and r is false.
```

In this circumstance you just described, if $q$ is true then  premise $q\rightarrow r$ is false; and in  this circumstance if $q$ is false then $p\rightarrow q$ is false. Hence, in either case, one of the two premises is false. Hence, in the circumstance where the conclusion $p\rightarrow r$ is false, at least one of the premises is false.

The argument we just gave in the previous paragraph is an example of one of the valid arguments we saw earlier.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission="none" options="check"}
 Which is it?
| disjunctive syllogism.
| modus ponens.
| *reasoning by cases.
| modus tollens.
```

# Week 4, Practice Problems

The practice problems in this set fall into four groups:

- [Atomic statements](#atomic-statements)
- [Simple quantifier statements](#simple-quantifier-statements)
- [Multiple quantifier statements](#multiple-quantifier-statements)
- [Connecting properties](#connecting-properties)

Before you begin the homework, you might consider printing a copy either to work out by hand as you go along, or to work with on a tablet. A nice pdf of this page is [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QHip9DdLxnYJH8b6Q_uXD-xa6yTGTMUG).

## Atomic statements

In the following problems we use the following key:

| $a$  =  "Angel"
| $b$  =  "Briana"
| $c$  =  "Cole"
| $d$  =  "Daniela"
| $C$  =  "is a congressman"
| $D$  =  "is a Democrat"
| $J$  =  "is a judge"
| $S$  =  "is senator"
| $R$  =  "is a Republican"

<br>

Remember that you have to "select all" and delete the entry in the first box, and then you have to press **return** at the end of the problem. If you need a refresher on how to type the propositional connectives on the keyboard, please consider reviewing [Typing the connectives on the keyboard](https://carnap.io/shared/logicteaching@g.ucla.edu/week01-section-main_connective.pandoc#typing-the-connectives-on-the-keyboard).

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 Ca/\Da : Angel is a congressman and Angel is a Democrat.
~~~

<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 Sa\/Sb : Angel is a senator or Briana is a senator.
~~~

<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 Dd->Rc : If Daniela is a Democrat then Cole is a Republican.
~~~

<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}

<br>

## Simple quantifier statements

In the following problems, we use the key:

| $a$  =  "Angel"
| $b$  =  "Briana"
| $c$  =  "Cole"
| $d$  =  "Daniela"
| $C$  = is compassionate
| $B$  = is brave
| $H$  = is honest

<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 AxHx/\~AxCx : Everyone is honest but not everyone is compassionate.
~~~

<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 ExBx/\ExCx : Someone is brave and someone is compassionate.
~~~

<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 (Bc/\~Hc)->Ex(Bx/\~Hx) : If Cole is brave and Cole is not honest, then someone is brave and not honest.
~~~

<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 Ax~Cx->(~Cb/\~Cc) : If everyone is not compassionate, then Briana is not compassionate and Cole is not compassionate.
~~~


<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 (ExBx/\ExHx)/\Ax(~Bx\/~Hx) : Someone is brave and someone is honest, but everyone is not brave or not honest.
~~~

<br>


## Multiple quantifier statements

In the following problems, we use the key:

| $a$  =  "Angel"
| $b$  =  "Briana"
| $c$  =  "Cole"
| $d$  =  "Daniela"
| $H$  = "is happy"
| $R$  = "is responsible"
| $O$  = "on time"


<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 ExOx/\Ex~Ox : Someone is on time and someone is not on time.
~~~


<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 (Oa/\~Ob)->(ExOx/\Ex~Ox) : If Angel is on time and Briana is not on time, then someone is on time and someone is not on time.
~~~

<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 Ax~Ox/\Ax~Hx : everyone is not on time and everyone is not happy
~~~

<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 (Ax~Ox/\Ax~Hx)->(~Oc/\~Hc) : If everyone is not on time and everyone is not happy, then Cole is not on time and Cole is not happy.
~~~

<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 (~Oc/\~Hc)->(~AxOx/\~AxHx) : If Cole is not on time and Cole is not happy, then not everyone is on time and not everyone is happy.
~~~


<br>

## Connecting properties

| $H$  =  "is high-quality"
| $M$  =  "is a musical"
| $P$  =  "is popular"
| $T$  =  "is a thriller"


<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 Ax(Mx->Hx) : All musicals are high-quality.
~~~

<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 Ex(Mx/\Tx) : Some musicals are thrillers.
~~~

<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 Ex(Tx/\Px)->Ax(Tx->Px) : If some thrillers are popular, then all thrillers are popular.
~~~

<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 Ex(Mx/\Px)/\Ex(Mx/\~Px) : Some musicals are popular and some musicals are not popular.
~~~

<br>

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="gamutND" submission="none"}
 ~Ax(Tx->Px)/\Ax((Hx/\Tx)->Px) : Not all thrillers are popular but all high-quality thrillers are popular.
